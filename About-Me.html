            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>I'm a UX/UI Designer currently expanding my skill set to include front-end web development. Presently, I work for a non-profit, <a href="http://www.noblis.org" target="_Blank">Noblis</a>, as a contractor for the federal government where I'm responsible for designing complex enterprise software.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>My Professional Life</h2>
            <p>I started my professional career in marketing a few years ago at a social media agency. Several months later, I landed a dream job in Copenhagen, Denmark and I was able to gain experience in several aspects of marketing, in addition to getting my first taste of user experience design.</p>
            <p>When I returned to the States, I began working in an inbound marketing role where I created content strategies to strengthen clients’ search rankings. Eventually I decided that user experience design needed a more pivotal role in my career, so I enrolled in General Assembly’s User Experience Design Immersive program to sharpen my skills.</p>
            <h2>My Personal Life</h2>
            <p>I enjoy admiring good design and pondering ways to improve design patterns that fall short of expectations. In my spare time, I like to enjoy live music, discovering new music, traveling and binge watching television shows on Netflix. At the moment, I'm challenging myself to learn to swim and pick up some front-end development skills before the summer is over.</p>
